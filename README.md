### Full Project Discription

** Accent Transformation Project **

1. Programming tasks: Build a voice conversion tool with which a spoken sentence of choice can be transformed into one with a specific accent. The choices of accents will be the Midwest, Southern, or British accent.
2. Design specifications: The completed GUI must allow the user to
- Record a sentence by reading from a text. Recognize the phonemes in the sentence.
- Select the accent one wishes to transform the recorded sentence into and map the phonemes in the accented sentence.
- Implement an LPC vocoder and synthesizer (Matlab) to regenerate the voice
3. Tests and Demonstration: Each team will be asked to step in front of the class to demon-
strate in 5 minutes their software interactively (best with a GUI). The test requirements are: (a) Record another studentâ€™s voice for the program to analyze and convert;
(b) Play back the result.
